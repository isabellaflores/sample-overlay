A sample overlay that draws some lines and a reticle on the screen.

It will also detect whether Notepad is running on the target machine, and will display its current status on the overlay.

You can download this overlay's source code from GitHub, and use it as a starting point for your own overlays.

By default, this overlay is configured to cost a very small amount of Nano, but you can make it free by editing overlay.json, and setting "price" to 0.
